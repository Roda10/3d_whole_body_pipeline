========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.304124
- Body height estimate: 1.581m
- Body width estimate: 1.026m
- Typical bone length: 0.7238m
- Coordinate center: [-0.032337491386943924, -0.355417930514273, -0.16791094480639826]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.038722
- Hand span estimate: 0.239m
- Hand length estimate: 0.137m
- Typical finger length: 0.0637m
- Coordinate center: [-0.0025008509035844262, -0.014841689235230927, -0.044909793301261026]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 7.854062
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 7.9x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 7.854062 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 7.9x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 7.854062 for all WiLoR→SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
