**3D Human Pose Fusion Pipeline - Current Status**

**Objective:** Fuse three specialized 3D human models (SMPLest-X, WiLoR, EMOCA) to create enhanced unified representation.

**Working Components:**
- ✅ **Unified pipeline**: `main.py` runs all three models concurrently 
- ✅ **SMPLest-X adapter**: Outputs full body SMPL-X parameters + mesh vertices (`smplx_mesh_cam`)
- ✅ **WiLoR adapter**: Outputs MANO hand parameters + 3D hand vertices
- ✅ **EMOCA adapter**: Outputs FLAME codes (shape/expression/pose) as JSON
- ✅ **Coordinate analysis**: Calculates transformations between model spaces
- ✅ **Parameter fusion**: Attempts to replace SMPL-X hand/face params with WiLoR/EMOCA

**Current Issue:** Parameter fusion shows no visual difference between original and "enhanced" mesh - parameters aren't actually being replaced/applied correctly.

**Technical Stack:**
- Working `render_mesh()` function from SMPLest-X visualization_utils
- SMPL-X model for mesh generation 
- All models output to structured JSON with actual 3D data

**Goal:** Direct parameter replacement fusion - use SMPL-X body as base, replace hand poses with WiLoR MANO params, replace facial expression with EMOCA codes, then regenerate single enhanced mesh.

**Key Files:** All adapters save parameters as JSON, coordinate analyzer calculates transforms, but actual mesh regeneration with fused parameters not working properly.
