Perfect! Now that we have clarity on the parameter structures, let's analyze the coordinate systems to understand how to properly align the outputs from all three models.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Coordinate System Analysis Plan**

Based on the parameter structure analysis, here's what we need to understand:

### **Key Questions to Answer:**
1. **SMPLest-X coordinate system**: What's the scale, origin, and orientation?
2. **WiLoR coordinate system**: How do hand coordinates relate to the body?
3. **EMOCA parameter space**: How do 50D expressions map to SMPL-X 10D?
4. **Transformation needed**: What math transforms WiLoR â†’ SMPLest-X space?

### **What We'll Analyze:**
- **3D coordinate ranges** (min/max XYZ values)
- **Scale differences** (typical distances between points)
- **Coordinate centers** (where is the origin for each model?)
- **Transformation parameters** (translation, rotation, scale needed)

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Approach**

I'll create a targeted coordinate analyzer that reads your exact file formats:

**Input**: Your pipeline results directory
**Output**: 
- Coordinate system comparison visualizations
- Transformation parameters for fusion
- Clear fusion strategy recommendations

### **Before I implement this, I need to confirm:**

1. **Should I create a new coordinate analyzer** that reads your specific parameter files (SMPLest-X JSON, WiLoR JSON, EMOCA codes)?

2. **Do you want the analysis to focus on**:
   - Finding the transformation to align WiLoR hands with SMPLest-X body?
   - Understanding the scale differences between models?
   - Generating the exact math needed for fusion?

3. **Any specific aspects of coordinate systems** you're most interested in (scale, translation, rotation)?

Once you confirm, I'll implement the coordinate system analyzer step by step, explaining each part as we go!
