# ==============================================================================
#  Robust Evaluation Control Script
#
#  Usage:
#    ./run_eval.sh start    - Starts the evaluation in the background
#    ./run_eval.sh stop     - Stops the running evaluation
#    ./run_eval.sh status   - Checks if the evaluation is running
#    ./run_eval.sh logs     - Shows the live log output
# ==============================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
# The python script to execute
PY_SCRIPT="evaluation/ehf_fusion_evaluator.py"
# The file where we will store the Process ID (PID)
PID_FILE="evaluation.pid"
# The log file where all output will be stored
LOG_FILE="final_evaluation.log"
# Arguments for the python script
SCRIPT_ARGS="--max_frames 1"

# --- Function to start the process ---
