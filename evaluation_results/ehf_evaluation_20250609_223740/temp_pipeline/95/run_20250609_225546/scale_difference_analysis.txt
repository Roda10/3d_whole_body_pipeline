========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.305883
- Body height estimate: 1.600m
- Body width estimate: 0.917m
- Typical bone length: 0.7845m
- Coordinate center: [-0.11468499382264423, -0.39971371375731307, -0.12282609591518875]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.048803
- Hand span estimate: 0.238m
- Hand length estimate: 0.207m
- Typical finger length: 0.0616m
- Coordinate center: [-0.0048721160484983045, 0.017083305782628913, -0.010899933944131574]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 6.267735
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 6.3x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 6.267735 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 6.3x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 6.267735 for all WiLoRâ†’SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
