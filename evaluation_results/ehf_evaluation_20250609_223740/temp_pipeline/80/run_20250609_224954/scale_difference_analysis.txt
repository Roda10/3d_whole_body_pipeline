========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.295407
- Body height estimate: 1.576m
- Body width estimate: 0.691m
- Typical bone length: 0.7359m
- Coordinate center: [0.015419822281403263, -0.2800949104946025, -0.19373808812050924]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.065044
- Hand span estimate: 0.305m
- Hand length estimate: 0.111m
- Typical finger length: 0.0620m
- Coordinate center: [0.004250925253348899, -0.003556528877228101, -0.07325234453991093]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 4.541649
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 4.5x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 4.541649 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 4.5x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 4.541649 for all WiLoR→SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
