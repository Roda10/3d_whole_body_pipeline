========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.265659
- Body height estimate: 1.505m
- Body width estimate: 0.629m
- Typical bone length: 0.7218m
- Coordinate center: [-0.12867244088981492, -0.35292016829017303, -0.18123114370081547]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.079733
- Hand span estimate: 0.336m
- Hand length estimate: 0.192m
- Typical finger length: 0.0643m
- Coordinate center: [-0.035328444596236346, -0.0070410612575556595, -0.048368897939609315]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 3.331843
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 3.3x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 3.331843 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 3.3x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 3.331843 for all WiLoRâ†’SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
