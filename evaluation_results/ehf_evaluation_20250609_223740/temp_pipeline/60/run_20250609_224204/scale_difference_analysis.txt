========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.343711
- Body height estimate: 1.677m
- Body width estimate: 0.880m
- Typical bone length: 0.8412m
- Coordinate center: [0.02153097775622006, -0.4993453695826287, -0.17044952838090213]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.079368
- Hand span estimate: 0.391m
- Hand length estimate: 0.190m
- Typical finger length: 0.0638m
- Coordinate center: [0.0025473516147133625, -0.0761275884233281, -0.009252219875203985]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 4.330579
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 4.3x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 4.330579 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 4.3x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 4.330579 for all WiLoR→SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
