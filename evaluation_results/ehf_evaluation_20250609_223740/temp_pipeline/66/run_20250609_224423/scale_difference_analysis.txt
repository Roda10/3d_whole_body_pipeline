========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.310609
- Body height estimate: 1.663m
- Body width estimate: 0.767m
- Typical bone length: 0.8450m
- Coordinate center: [0.0064154430462496125, -0.4751875568045317, -0.1838616141437614]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.113064
- Hand span estimate: 0.473m
- Hand length estimate: 0.182m
- Typical finger length: 0.0636m
- Coordinate center: [0.004386334782969063, -0.030907992364845902, 0.01903119882286507]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 2.747198
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 2.7x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 2.747198 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 2.7x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 2.747198 for all WiLoRâ†’SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
