========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.275946
- Body height estimate: 1.452m
- Body width estimate: 0.667m
- Typical bone length: 0.7097m
- Coordinate center: [-0.040514750977175946, -0.21509931720521328, -0.3559379577636719]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.094610
- Hand span estimate: 0.417m
- Hand length estimate: 0.175m
- Typical finger length: 0.0643m
- Coordinate center: [-0.005751166082703171, 0.04079950954922945, -0.06716906514430566]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 2.916659
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 2.9x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 2.916659 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 2.9x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 2.916659 for all WiLoRâ†’SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
