========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.278363
- Body height estimate: 1.556m
- Body width estimate: 0.627m
- Typical bone length: 0.7291m
- Coordinate center: [-0.02141070502035211, -0.30186323179815805, -0.22003602633511063]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.077379
- Hand span estimate: 0.389m
- Hand length estimate: 0.064m
- Typical finger length: 0.0640m
- Coordinate center: [-0.002667377224661276, 0.005091152691993393, -0.0884245314101442]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 3.597387
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 3.6x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 3.597387 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 3.6x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 3.597387 for all WiLoRâ†’SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
