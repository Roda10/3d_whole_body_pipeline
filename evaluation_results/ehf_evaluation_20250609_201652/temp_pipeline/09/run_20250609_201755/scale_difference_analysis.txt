========================================

1. COORDINATE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------------------
SMPLest-X (Body Model):
- Scale (std): 0.283548
- Body height estimate: 1.155m
- Body width estimate: 0.845m
- Typical bone length: 0.6238m
- Coordinate center: [-0.33649516383009237, 0.07360268922617835, -0.17024129324585852]

WiLoR (Hand Model):
- Scale (std): 0.073594
- Hand span estimate: 0.269m
- Hand length estimate: 0.185m
- Typical finger length: 0.0633m
- Coordinate center: [-0.008891362464953223, 0.09046533493717754, 0.024281602153919068]

2. SCALE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Scale Ratio (SMPLest-X / WiLoR): 3.852871
Interpretation: SMPLest-X is 3.9x larger scale than WiLoR

This means:
- WiLoR coordinates need to be multiplied by 3.852871 to match SMPLest-X scale
- SMPLest-X operates at approximately 3.9x the scale of WiLoR
- Both models appear to use metric units (meters)

3. WHY THIS SCALE DIFFERENCE EXISTS
---------------------------------
The scale difference is expected and justified because:

a) Model Design Focus:
   - SMPLest-X: Full body model requiring larger coordinate space
   - WiLoR: Hand-specific model with finer detail requirements

b) Resolution Requirements:
   - Body models need ~2m range for full human height
   - Hand models need ~0.2m range for hand details

c) Optimization Targets:
   - SMPLest-X optimized for body pose and shape
   - WiLoR optimized for finger articulation and fine details

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Use the calculated scale factor 3.852871 for all WiLoRâ†’SMPLest-X transformations
- Verify scale consistency by checking that transformed hand size matches anatomical expectations
- Consider scale-aware blending near wrist attachment points
